# Fantasy Cricket League

In Fantasy league, participants act as managers. Each manager in the league can build a team of six players. For example:

    Team 1: Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Jadeja, Sachin, Rahul
    Team 2: Dhoni, Pant, Raina, Ashwin, Shikhar, Ashwin

The fantasy program will take in the performance of these players during the actual matches as inputs and calculate the number of points earned by the team. The team that gets the highest points wins.

The points are allocated with the help of following rules:

    Rule 1: A player earns 1 point for each run scored
    Rule 2: A player earns additional 10 bonus points for scoring 25 runs
    Rule 3: A player earns -5 points for scoring duck (0 run)
    Rule 4: A player earns 40 points for each wicket
    Rule 5: A player earns additional 20 bonus points for taking 3 wickets

Write a program to calculate the total points for two teams and display the points scored by the teams and declare the winning team.
